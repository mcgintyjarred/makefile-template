This code provides a template for a basic makefile for an Intel Assembly
program.

What you need to add:

1. Your .asm file name. (ASM_SRC)
2. What you want your object file name to be. (ASM_OBJ)
3. What you want your executable file name to be. (OUTPUT)

Then place the makefile in the relavent directory and run the command "make".
